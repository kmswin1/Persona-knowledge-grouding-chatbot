  abstract = 	 {Persona and Knowledge dual context opendomain chat is a novel dialogue generation
task introduced recently (Jang et al., 2021).
While Persona and Knowledge is each interesting context of open-domain dialogue, the combination of both has not been well studied. We
tackle Persona-Knowledge identification and
response generation tasks in this paper. We design an informed data augmentation strategy
that is compatible with neural Q&A retrieval
models. With the augmented data, we perform permutative Persona-Knowledge evaluation and successive Persona search fine-tuning.
Furthermore, we perform dialogue generation
with various decoding techniques and illustrate crucial elements. We achieve SOTA
across official metrics with 93.99% Grounding
accuracy average and 23.62 SacreBLEU score.}
