gold:  olay Lake was first altered around 1850 by European settlers who dynamited a natural earth dam on the lake's south side to allow for more intensive agricultural cultivation and grazing of the basin; as a result, the lake became almost dry during the summer months, when rainfall in this area is at its seasonal nadir.
pred:  Yes, Dartmoor has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than locations at similar height in the rest of England.

NER : England William the Conqueror Church
Knowledge : Following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, William the Conqueror confiscated landed estates, but he respected Church property. At St Augustine's Abbey, the Anglo-Saxon buildings were completely reconstructed in the form of a typical Norman Benedictine monastery. By 1100, all the original buildings had disappeared under a Romanesque edifice. There was further rebuilding as a result of the great fire in 1168. The fire's destruction accounts for the paucity of historical records for the preceding period.

The new signal box controlled 295 sets of points and 446 signals and detected occupancy on 300 sections of track and seven automatic block sections. In the signalling centre there were four interlockings, one controlling the Holzkirchen wing station, two controlling the tracks of the main hall and the other one controlling the Starnberg wing station. The new interlockings needed only 38 staff for operations and 12 for maintaining the signal technology, saving 93 jobs.

gold:   castle located on top of a hill has many military adaptations, acting on the defenses of the place over the years. Due to its strategic location, the architect who planned it is believed to be the foreigner of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Sir Samuel Turner II, as he was a consultant on design and tactical aspects within the castle. As you work with ancient history, I believe it may be a good idea to visit this place.
