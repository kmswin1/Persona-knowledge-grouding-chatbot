Knowledge : It began as the course of a Glacial Columbia River. The Cordilleran ice sheet's Okanogan lobe extended southward across the Columbia Rivers pathway and onto the southern plateau creating an ice dam.

The river at Grand Coulee found no existing valley and thus forged its own pathway across the divide, creating the Upper

gold:   a Washington State resident and lover of nature-related issues, I think it's important to know that at the beginning the course of the Columbia Glacial River to the southern highlands created an ice dam, which retracted the waters of Columbia Glacial Lake, forcing them east of Washington. Without finding a gap, the river made its own way through the division, creating the Upper Coulee; upon encountering a steep slope, the new river would have cascaded from the 800-foot edge onto a wide plain where Coulee City and Dry Falls State Park are now. pred:  It began as the course of a Glacial Columbia River. The Cordilleran ice sheet's Ok
Knowledge : Upper Grand Coulee began as an 800 feet (240 m) cascade just north of Coulee City. As the rush of water eroded the surface, it steepened into a waterfall. The falls continued to erode backward (northward) creating the canyon. The river above the falls was shallow and much wider than the gorge. Thus, it wrapped around the lip of the main falls creating lateral falls.
